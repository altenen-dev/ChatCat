# Net-Cat

## Description
This project work similar to how the original NetCat works, i.e. it creates a group chat. The project is made according to the following requirements:
- TCP connection between server and multiple clients (relation of 1 to many).
- A name requirement to the client.
- Control connections quantity.
- Clients must be able to send messages to the chat.
- Do not broadcast EMPTY messages from a client.
- Messages sent, must be identified by the time that was sent and the user name of who sent the message, example : `[2020-01-20 15:48:41][client.name]:[client.message]`
- If a Client joins the chat, all the previous messages sent to the chat must be uploaded to the new Client.
- If a Client connects to the server, the rest of the Clients must be informed by the server that the Client joined the group.
- If a Client exits the chat, the rest of the Clients must be informed by the server that the Client left.
- All Clients must receive the messages sent by other Clients.
- If a Client leaves the chat, the rest of the Clients must not disconnect.
- If there is no port specified, then set as default the port 8989. Otherwise, program must respond with usage message: `[USAGE]: ./TCPChat $port`
